Release Notes - Open Images Platform - Version OIP 1.2.2
--------------------------------------------------------
version $Id$

VERSION 1.2.2
=============

Version upgrade to fix Maven build.


UPGRADING 1.2 -> 1.2.1
======================

We have added a new field mediator to our media nodes. This is done to keep track of for example
media in used on Wikimedia.

If you install OIP for the very first time, you don't have to do anything. All tables and fields
are created automatically. For a MySQL database with views that is, other databases have in general
quite similar commands to add fields:

ALTER TABLE oi_mediafragments_table ADD mediator TEXT;
DROP VIEW oi_mediafragments;
DROP VIEW oi_videofragments;
DROP VIEW oi_audiofragments;
DROP VIEW oi_imagefragments;

ALTER TABLE oi_mediafragments_translations_table ADD mediator TEXT;
DROP VIEW oi_mediafragments_translations;

Or if you are on a more standard MySQL database without views:

ALTER TABLE oi_mediafragments ADD mediator TEXT;
ALTER TABLE oi_imagefragments ADD mediator TEXT;
ALTER TABLE oi_audiofragments ADD mediator TEXT;
ALTER TABLE oi_videofragments ADD mediator TEXT;
ALTER TABLE oi_mediafragments_translations ADD mediator TEXT;


UPGRADING 1.1.1 -> 1.2
======================
Main new features are the API token and API, which are used to login and post data into Open Images.
Version 1.2 of Open Images includes a Download API which enables users to download media from other
sources. Authentication is done with an API token, an encrypted string that contains username and 
password. The key or password to encrypt all API tokens is a property of 'mmbaseusers'. The builder 
'mmbaseusers' (normally in config/builders/mmbaseusers.xml) has a default value 'pindakaas'.
The same API key is also used as value for a browser cookie to stay logged in if you choose to
check this option in the login box.

Pages in portal footer are placed there with a new relation type named footerrel. This is done to 
make pages easier to sort in the editors and to be able to move them from footer to header with 
jQuery Sortable. In the tools sections is an editor to replace all posrel relations in the footer 
by footerrel relations.

You have to change the owner of 'properties' builder in typedef to 'siteusers'. (TODO: make script?) 
Properties is used by the Download API to keep track of the status of a download.


Database updates: new and changed fields and InnoDB
---------------------------------------------------
A new field 'hasformat' has been added to media items (builder: mediafragments). It describes 
the original format the media was published in. This means you have to update your database. 
Stop you applicationserver and run the following commands before installing the new version of 
Open Images for MySQL with views (the default setup of OIP) the commands are: 

  ALTER TABLE oi_mediafragments_table ADD hasformat VARCHAR(255);

The field 'contributor' has been enlarged:

  ALTER TABLE oi_mediafragments_table MODIFY contributor TEXT;
  
To effectuate the changes above on MySQL with views you must do:
  
  DROP VIEW oi_mediafragments;
  DROP VIEW oi_videofragments;
  DROP VIEW oi_audiofragments;
  DROP VIEW oi_imagefragments;

A new field 'licensekey' has been added to licenses. It can keep short references to licenses 
with values like 'cc-by-sa' etc.

  ALTER TABLE oi_licenses_table ADD licensekey VARCHAR(24);
  DROP VIEW oi_licenses;
 
Less important but also database related: we decided to convert our MySQL tables to InnoDB 
to fully support transactions. If you have a previous installation of Open Images and are using 
a MySQL version lower then 5.5 you probably have ISAM tables. Since MySQL 5.5 InnoDB is default. 
You can convert your tables with f.fe. 'ALTER TABLE oi_mediafragments_table ENGINE=InnoDB;'.
To have MMBase know it is running on MySQL with transaction support you need the following
settings for 'mmbaseroot' (see '/WEB-INF/config/mmbaseroot.xml' or your 'context.xml').

  <Environment name="mmbase/mmbaseroot/database" value="mysql-transactions_with_views" 
    type="java.lang.String" />

MMBase runs on various other databases that may already have support for transactions.


Set aliases for rank 'portal manager' and group 'project managers'
------------------------------------------------------------------
Portal managers are users with rank 'portal manager' (at least) and belong to the group
'project managers' to have certain creation rights. This rank and group can be found in
basic editors or my_editors and need to get aliases, respectievely 
'cloudcontextsecurity_rank_portal_manager' and 
'cloudcontextsecurity_group_projectmanagers'. 
These aliases are used in a new editor to create portals and assign portal managers to them.

Release Notes - Open Images Platform - Version OIP 1.1
------------------------------------------------------


UPGRADING 1.0.2 -> 1.1
======================
Open Images uses a new font, it uses kerning that requires at least version 6.4.7-8 of 
ImageMagick. You can switch the use of the font of by removing the oip:t tags 
in '/WEB-INF/tags/oip/h2.tagx' and '/WEB-INF/tags/oip/h3.tagx'.

Make sure you altered the max_allowed_packet settings in MySQL's configuration. OIP 1.1 creates
thumbnails from videos that in some cases are rather large depending on the resolution of the 
video. You can alter these in '/etc/my.cnf' from (normally) the default 'max_allowed_packet=1M;'
to 'max_allowed_packet=32M;'.

The fields coverage, dc_creator and relation were added to mediafragments_translations. To pools
a field language was added. Alterations to MySQL tables:

  ALTER TABLE oi_pools_table ADD language CHAR(12);
  DROP VIEW oi_pools;

  ALTER TABLE oi_mediafragments_translations_table ADD dc_creator VARCHAR(255);
  ALTER TABLE oi_mediafragments_translations_table ADD relation TEXT;
  ALTER TABLE oi_mediafragments_translations_table ADD coverage TEXT;
  DROP VIEW oi_mediafragments_translations;
  

Some new tables were introduced, like f.e. for thumbnails, but normally they are automatically 
initialized by mmbase. 

This release is build with MMBase 1.9.6 and should run with Java 1.6 and higher on 
Apache Tomcat version 6 and higher.
